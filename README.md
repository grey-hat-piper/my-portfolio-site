First portfolio site ever
Prince Derek Martey | Developer Portfolio

Hi there! I'm Prince Derek Martey , an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for Embedded Systems, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, and the art of building things that actually work.
This is my personal portfolio website, crafted not just to showcase my skills and projects, but to reflect who I am ; methodical, curious, and a little obsessed with doing things the Batman way: silent, precise, impactful.

# Whatâ€™s Inside?

- A brief dive into who I am
- My academic journey
- Real-world experience (internships, field work)
- Hands-on tech projects (hardware + software)
- Contact section for connection

All built with clean HTML/CSS, styled in dark mode because â€” letâ€™s face it â€” light mode isnâ€™t Gotham-approved.ðŸ¤£

# Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- Vanilla CSS3 with grid/flex layout, animations & responsiveness  
- GitHub Pages for live deployment

Simple. Fast. Purposeful.

# Inspiration & Why I Built This
I wanted a portfolio that didnâ€™t just tick boxes but actually tells my story ;one where engineering meets creativity. Whether it's AI, Arduino, or software logic, my mission is to build meaningful tech, solve tough problems, and always keep learning.

If you want to collaborate, mentor, or just chat tech... Iâ€™m all ears:
